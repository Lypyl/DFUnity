# Daggerfall Tools for Unity

Daggerfall Tools for Unity is a code asset which acts as a bridge between Daggerfall’s binary data files and Unity3D.
It consists of a mature API for opening and converting almost all of Daggerfall’s content files – plus a set of editor
windows, example classes, and prefabs for quickly converting Daggerfall’s environments into fully functional Unity scenes.
