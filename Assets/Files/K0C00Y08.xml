You've heard of _book_?
It is a very rare tome, almost never seen, but I have located a copy buried away in a dungeon here in %reg. I will give you _upfront_ gold pieces now and _gold_ gold once the book is in my hands. Agreed?
<section/>
I am looking for a very special book, one
that is not available in any store, at least not
for any price less than astronomical. Recently, I
have heard that a copy of it has surfaced not too
far from here, in a dungeon. If you will accept
this quest to find this tome, I will give you
_upfront_ gold pieces now and another _gold_ gold
pieces when you return. Do we have
a deal then, %pcf?

                          Very well. I'll look for a
                           different mercenary then.

                 Good. I'll give you =queston_ days to get the
                          book out of ___mondung_ and
                return. After that time, the _gold_ gold pieces
                    will be forfeit. The name of the book is
                               _book_. Good luck,
                                     %pcf.

                       Ah, marvelous. Here's the _gold_
                     gold pieces I promised. Thank you very
                                  much, %pcf.

I got a boil the other day ... but it healed.
<section/>
I just had a three hour conversation about the weather.
<section/>
The weather is pretty usual for this time of year.
<section/>
It seems a trifle coolish in %cn for this time of year.
<section/>
It sure is a lot warmer today than this time last year.
<section/>
My great aunt is going to a specialist across the Bay.
<section/>
It's always funny what time it gets dark around here.
<section/>
We should erect a war statue around here.
<section/>
The kids these days with their magic. %oth, I don't know.
<section/>
I had the weirdest dream last night.
<section/>
I heard a great joke. %jok
<section/>
%jok Actually, that's a joke.
<section/>
%jok Can you explain that to me?
<section/>
The legal system in %reg has good points and bad ones.
