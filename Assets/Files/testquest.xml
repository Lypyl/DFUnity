                 I have a friend, a potential ally, who is in
                 need of discreet assistance. It's a relatively
                   simple salvage operation, one for which my
                  friend would happily pay very handsomely and
                  I would greatly appreciate. It will need to
                 be accomplished very soon, within =1stparton_
                days. I'll go into detail, if you're interested.

               Well, saying no from the beginning is definitely
              preferable to saying yes and failing. I am a little
                        disappointed, but that'll pass.

<text sid="AcceptQuest$1002">
               Excellent, I knew you'd help. Now then, my friend
                         is _qgfriend_ of ___qgfriend_.
            %g has lost a gem, a sapphire, and my spies have tracked
                    it down to ___itemdung_, of all places.
                          _qgfriend_ needs this stone,
                   because %g borrowed it from a third party.
                 If it's not in %g3 hands in =1stparton_ days,
             well, there will be considerable trouble. Furthermore,
             the persons who now possess the stone will, according
                to my spy, be vacating ___itemdung_ any day now.
               Obviously, you'd best leave immediately to get to
              ___qgfriend_ in =1stparton_ days with the sapphire.
                        Good luck, %pcf.  Make me proud.

                         The sapphire, %pcf? Have you
                           forgotten something? %oth!
</text>
<text sid="QuestComplete">
                         Oh, %pcf, you don't know how
                  relieved I am that you found that sapphire.
                   I don't even want to think about it if you
                  hadn't. Here's the finest reward I can give
                       you, a _reward_. Please accept it,
                            with my sincere thanks.

Those thieves in ___itemdung_ have some pretty powerful guards.
<section/>
_qgfriend_ has been awfully nervous lately.
</text>
<text sid="RumorsPostfailure$1006">
Apparently some powerful wizard has it in for _qgfriend_.
<section/>
_questgiver_ has been complaining about the dearth of decent %ra mercenaries.

<text sid="RumorsPostsuccess$1007">
Turns out _qgfriend_ didn't steal that gem after all. They found it.
<section/>
_qgfriend_ was called a thief, but they found the gem %g supposedly stole.

<text sid="QuestorPostsuccess$1008">
My friend tells me that you got the sapphire. Now, what can I do for you?
<section/>
I'm glad to see you again. My friend appreciated the little blue gift.

<text sid="QuestorPostfailure$1009">
                         I'm impressed by your nerve,
                              %pcn. You failed the
                          quest and yet return with no
                                   sapphire.

%qdt: _questgiver_
 of ___questgiver_ has sent me
 on a mission to find a sapphire stolen from
 %g3 friend, _qgfriend_ of

 I have =1stparton_ days to get the sapphire from
 ___itemdung_ to __qgfriend_
 to earn my reward.
