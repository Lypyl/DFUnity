sid: QuestorOffer. Value: 
I am looking for a very special book, one
that is not available in any store, at least not
for any price less than astronomical. Recently, I
have heard that a copy of it has surfaced not too
far from here, in a dungeon. If you will accept
this quest to find this tome, I will give you
_upfront_ gold pieces now and another _gold_ gold
pieces when you return. Do we have
a deal then, %pcf?

sid: RefuseQuest$1001. Value: 
                          Very well. I'll look for a
                           different mercenary then.

sid: AcceptQuest$1002. Value: 
                 Good. I'll give you =queston_ days to get the
                          book out of ___mondung_ and
                return. After that time, the _gold_ gold pieces
                    will be forfeit. The name of the book is
                               _book_. Good luck,
                                     %pcf.

sid: QuestComplete. Value: 
                       Ah, marvelous. Here's the _gold_
                     gold pieces I promised. Thank you very
                                  much, %pcf.

sid: RumorsDuringQuest$1005. Value: 
The legal system in %reg has good points and bad ones.

sid: RumorsPostfailure$1006. Value: 
The legal system in %reg has it good points and bad ones.

sid: RumorsPostsuccess$1007. Value: 
_qgiver_ is happy as a harpy about %g3 new acquisition.

sid: QuestorPostsuccess$1008. Value: 
What can I do for you, o %ra who brought me _book_?

sid: QuestorPostfailure$1009. Value: 
                            As _book_ is lost once
                          again, I find it in dubious
                          taste that you are bothering
                              me. Go get stuffed.

sid: QuestLogEntry$1010. Value: 
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 __qgiver_, ___qgiver_ has
 sent me to ___mondung_ in
 search of _book_,
 a very rare book. I will be given _gold_
 gold pieces if I return in =queston_ days or less.

sid: $1011. Value: 
                                 You picked up
                                    _book_.

sid: $1012. Value: 
                               _qgiver_ will be
                       angry. This is past the time when
                        you were to bring %g2 the book.
